**Meta title:** How to Have a Performance Review Conversation That Actually Works  
**Meta description:** Most performance reviews waste everyone's time. Here's how to run one that drives real development, surfaces honest feedback, and leaves your employee motivated — not demoralized.  
**Excerpt:** The average performance review takes two weeks of preparation time and produces almost no behaviour change. This is how to run one differently: structured, honest, and actually useful for both sides.

Most performance reviews are a ritual. They happen because they have to happen, produce a number, and are promptly forgotten by both the manager and the employee within a week.

The problem isn't the format. It's the absence of conversation.

A performance review is not a verdict. It's a conversation — the most important one a manager has with each person on their team. When it's run well, it surfaces blind spots, aligns expectations, and gives people a clear sense of where they stand and where they're going. When it's run poorly, it produces defensiveness, confusion, and the quiet certainty that nothing will change.

This guide is for managers who want to run the second kind. Or the first kind. The good one.

## Why Most Performance Reviews Fail

Before the how, it's worth understanding the what: what makes most reviews useless.

**The assessment is a surprise.** The employee didn't know they were underperforming in certain areas. The feedback feels like an ambush.

**It's one-directional.** The manager talks, the employee nods. There's no real conversation — just an announcement.

**It's backward-looking only.** The review covers what happened in the last cycle with no meaningful discussion of what should happen next.

**The feedback is vague.** "Communication could be stronger" or "more strategic thinking needed" — phrases that sound like feedback but contain no actionable signal.

**The stakes feel too high.** Employees know this conversation affects compensation and promotion, so they defend rather than engage.

The fix for all of these starts before you open the review document.

## Before the Conversation: Three Things That Matter More Than the Script

### 1. No surprises — ever

If something in your written review is genuinely new to your employee, you've already failed. Significant performance issues should have been raised in real-time, during the cycle, as they occurred. The review should confirm and consolidate observations the employee already broadly knows about — not introduce them.

If you find yourself about to deliver surprising negative feedback in a performance review, stop. Either you've been avoiding a difficult conversation, or you haven't been paying close enough attention during the year. Address this first.

### 2. Self-assessment before your assessment

Give your employee a structured self-assessment to complete before you write your review. Ask them: What did you accomplish this period? Where did you fall short? What do you want to develop? Where do you want to go?

This does two things. First, it tells you where your views align and diverge — the gaps are your most important conversations. Second, it shifts the frame: the review becomes a dialogue between two people's perspectives, not a monologue from one.

### 3. Separate compensation from development

If the compensation outcome is known before the conversation, say so upfront. "Before we get into the review, I want to be clear that you're getting [X]" — and then move on. When employees don't know what the compensation outcome is, they spend the entire conversation trying to decode signals rather than engaging with the development content.

Many organisations have separated these entirely: comp announcement in one meeting, development review in another. If you have that option, use it.

## The Conversation: A Structure That Works

### Open with their experience first

Start by asking them how they felt the period went — before you share any of your views. "Before I get into my feedback, I'd like to hear how you experienced this period overall."

This does several things: it signals that you're interested in dialogue, not just delivery. It gives you their frame before you impose yours. And often, employees will raise their own concerns before you have to — which is a very different conversation from one where you raise those concerns first.

### Anchor on specifics, not characteristics

The most common performance feedback mistake is commenting on character or traits rather than behaviour. "You need to be more proactive" is not useful feedback. "In the Q3 project planning phase, you waited for direction rather than proposing a timeline — what was going on there?" is.

For every significant observation in your review, have a specific example. Not because you need to prove your point, but because specific examples are the only feedback people can actually act on.

### Use the SBI model for difficult observations

For any feedback that might trigger defensiveness, use the Situation-Behaviour-Impact (SBI) framework:

- **Situation:** "In last quarter's leadership team meeting..."
- **Behaviour:** "...when the product roadmap was being debated, you didn't contribute any perspective even though you'd raised concerns with me beforehand..."
- **Impact:** "...which meant the team made a decision without your input, and you later felt the outcome wasn't what you wanted."

This frame is neutral. It describes what happened and why it mattered without making a character judgement. The employee can engage with the specifics rather than defending their identity.

### Acknowledge what you got wrong, too

The best managers use performance reviews as an opportunity to reflect on their own performance as well. "Looking back, I should have been clearer about what success looked like on the X project" or "I didn't give you enough runway to develop this skill — that's on me."

This isn't weakness. It's intellectual honesty that models the kind of reflection you're asking of your employee. And it changes the dynamic: you're two people examining a period together, not a judge issuing a verdict.

### Spend more than half the time on the future

Most reviews spend 80% of the time on the past and 20% on the future. This is backwards. The past is fixed. The future is where both of you can do something.

Ask: What do you want to focus on developing this period? What would it look like if you were operating at the next level? What kind of support do you need from me?

Then commit to specific actions: projects, experiences, coaching, feedback loops, or resources that will actually move the needle on the development areas you've identified.

## Difficult Conversations Within the Review

### The "you're at risk" conversation

If someone is significantly underperforming and their role is at risk, the performance review is not the place to introduce this. You should have had a formal performance conversation — with documentation — well before this point.

The review in this context is a progress checkpoint on an already-established improvement plan, not the first time the word "serious" has been used.

If you're at this point and haven't had those prior conversations, you have a harder job: you need to be very direct in the review, set clear expectations with specific timelines, and make the consequences explicit. This is uncomfortable. It's also one of the most important things a manager can do.

### The "not getting promoted" conversation

This is often harder than the underperformance conversation, because it involves disappointing someone who's doing good work.

Be direct. "I'm not recommending you for promotion this cycle" — not "I'm not sure the timing is right" or "let's see how the next quarter goes." Vague answers are worse than honest ones. They leave people uncertain and planning for an outcome that may not be realistic.

Then explain specifically what promotion to the next level actually requires — not in general terms, but in terms of what *they* specifically need to demonstrate. Give them a development plan with real milestones. And commit to revisiting it.

### The "everything is fine but they're bored" conversation

High performers who are disengaged are often harder to manage than low performers. They're doing their job. The numbers are fine. But they've checked out.

Ask directly: "How engaged are you feeling in your work right now?" and be prepared to hear an honest answer. If someone's staying purely for the paycheck while mentally job-hunting, you'd rather know. And often, a direct conversation about what would re-energize them reveals options you hadn't considered — different projects, more ownership, structural changes that are genuinely within your power.

## Common Mistakes (and What to Do Instead)

| Mistake | What to do instead |
|---|---|
| Delivering feedback the employee has never heard before | Surface issues in real-time throughout the year |
| Rating "meets expectations" when expectations were vague | Define what success looks like before the period begins |
| Generic feedback ("be more strategic") | Anchor every point to a specific situation and behaviour |
| Spending 90% of the conversation on the past | Front-load acknowledgement, shift quickly to future |
| Ending with "any questions?" | End with "what are you taking away from this conversation?" |
| Sending the review before the conversation | Discuss first, share the written document after |

## The Role of Ongoing Coaching Between Reviews

Performance reviews are retrospectives on a coaching relationship that should have been active throughout the year. If the review feels high-stakes and fraught, it's often because the feedback loop was missing in between.

The managers who give the best performance reviews are the ones who have been giving real-time feedback, having development conversations, and checking in on progress throughout the cycle. The review is then a summary, not an event.

This is the gap that most traditional feedback processes don't fill: the consistent, between-meeting accountability and development support that turns an annual conversation into an ongoing relationship.

Better Coaching is built specifically for this gap — daily check-ins, structured skill development, and accountability tracking between the formal conversations. The performance review becomes easier when the coaching hasn't stopped.

## A Preparation Checklist

Use this before every performance review:

- [ ] Have I surfaced all significant observations in real-time during the cycle? (No surprises rule)
- [ ] Have I asked for a self-assessment from the employee?
- [ ] Do I have specific examples for every significant observation?
- [ ] Have I separated the compensation conversation from the development conversation?
- [ ] Have I defined what the next level looks like for this employee specifically?
- [ ] Do I have concrete commitments I'm making — not just for them, but for my own development as their manager?
- [ ] Have I thought about what *I* could have done differently this cycle?

## FAQ

**How long should a performance review conversation last?**
45–90 minutes for most individual contributors. More for senior roles or complex situations. Never less than 45 minutes — anything shorter signals you haven't taken it seriously. Book 90 minutes and end early if you don't need it. Don't rush the development conversation.

**Should I share the written review before or after the conversation?**
After. Always. Sending the review before means the employee reads it in isolation, forms reactions without context, and arrives at the meeting already partially defensive. The conversation shapes how the written document lands. Have the conversation, then share the document.

**What if the employee gets emotional or defensive?**
Don't back down from the substance, but do adjust your pace. "I can hear this is difficult. Let's take a minute." Acknowledge the emotion without abandoning the feedback. If the conversation needs to pause and continue another day, that's legitimate — but it shouldn't be an excuse to avoid the difficult content permanently.

**How do I handle a review where I barely managed the person due to their high level of autonomy?**
Be honest about the limits of your observation. "You operate largely independently, so my visibility into [specific area] is limited — I'd like to hear your perspective on how that went." Then use the self-assessment and any output or stakeholder feedback you do have. And commit to better visibility next cycle.

**What about 360 feedback — should I include it?**
Yes, if you have it. Third-party perspectives are more credible and often carry more weight than manager observations alone. But don't use 360 feedback as a shield: "others said" as a way to avoid owning your perspective. The 360 supplements your view; it doesn't replace it.

**How do I give a performance review to someone more experienced than me?**
Focus on outcomes and behaviours, not telling them how to do their job. "I noticed X outcome" and "how are you thinking about Y?" rather than prescriptive advice. You may also have less to give and more to ask. That's fine. The most experienced people often benefit most from structured reflection — which you can facilitate even without deep domain expertise.

Performance reviews are one of the highest-leverage things a manager does. They're also one of the most consistently handled poorly. The gap is almost always the same: too much performance theatre, not enough actual conversation.

If you approach the conversation as a genuine dialogue between two people who both want the employee to succeed, most of the other techniques in this guide will follow naturally. The structure matters. But the intention matters more.
